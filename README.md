# Identification And Detection of Driver Drowsiness Using Machine Learning Technique

# Overview: 
This project aims to develop a system for detecting drowsiness in drivers using computer vision techniques. Drowsy driving is a significant cause of accidents worldwide, leading to injuries and fatalities. By employing machine learning algorithms and image processing, this project seeks to create a real-time monitoring system that alerts drivers when signs of drowsiness are detected, thereby potentially preventing accidents and saving lives.

# Key Features:
- Real-time monitoring of driver's facial features and eye movements.
- Detection of drowsiness indicators such as eye closure.
- Alerts for drivers when signs of drowsiness are detected, prompting them to take breaks or corrective actions.

# Technologies Used:
- Python for backend development.
- OpenCV for image and video processing.
- Machine learning libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training drowsiness detection models.
- GUI development (optional) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt for user interface implementation.
- Integration with hardware devices such as webcams or onboard cameras for data acquisition.

# conclusion:
This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes. While it may help in detecting drowsiness in drivers, it should not be relied upon solely for ensuring road safety. Always prioritize safe driving practices and adhere to traffic laws and regulations.
